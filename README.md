## App Brainstorming

### My favorite apps:

#### Youtube
- Videos have bar segments that describe the topic of the video segment
- Can add favorite videos to folder
#### Messages
- Can create groupchat names and photos
- Can include effects with messages
#### Spotify
- Can save songs to playlists
- Highlights lyrics of songs to track where the singer is

### Potential App Idea:
An idea that I would like to build is a chores sharing app. It syncs a list of chores between a family household and allows everyone to see what needs to be done around the house. Some features that I'm thinking of having in the app is having a shared chores list and a personal chores list. The shared chores list can have to-do items that are assigned to the entire family or to a specific group of people. For the universal to-do items, multiple people can check it off or assign it to themselves, while for assigned to-do items, only the people that the task is assigned to can check it off, with a notification sent when the item is completed. The tasks can be assigned a certain due date, with a countdown to when the item needs to be done, and when a task is created and assigned, it'll send a notification to the members in the household. There can also be a description for the item.
